An outdated JavaScript library (jquery ui.min.js) was found with a known Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, classified as low risk, though it was not exploitable due to the absence of the vulnerable functionality in use. It was recommended to apply the latest security updates and integrate checks to prevent future deployment of vulnerable dependencies. Another low-risk issue was account enumeration, where a discrepancy in the registration process allowed attackers to determine the validity of user email addresses. This was mitigated by a CAPTCHA challenge, but it was recommended to alter the registration flow to remove manual enumeration opportunities. Additionally, an informational finding was identified regarding Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), where several features could trigger DNS, HTTP, and SMTP interactions with arbitrarily specified hosts. No data exfiltration or access to internal resources was detected, but it was recommended to consider adding CAPTCHA challenges to the tools available when unauthenticated to further mitigate potential abuse. The penetration test report did not confirm that the findings have been remediated.",

This is the third iteration of penetration testing, which has helped to improve that posture. ABC Inc. demonstrated a willingness and culture to develop and deploy their solutions with a focus on security. ABC Inc. remained in contact throughout the engagement and provided all additional information that was requested. This collaboration enabled the consultant to deliver the highest quality assessment possible within the available time. Key Findings ● Vulnerabilities in Outdated Software Detected (Low Risk): One outdated JavaScript library was located containing a known Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. ABC Inc. did not use the vulnerable functionality, so it was not vulnerable to that XSS. ● Account Enumeration (Low Risk): A new instance was reported in the registration process. Exploitation of this was already protected from automation by a CAPTCHA. ● Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (Informational): Several features could be used to trigger DNS, HTTP, and SMTP interactions with arbitrarily specified hosts. No data exfiltration or access to internal resources was detected. 2 Summary of Vulnerabilities ● Low Risk Vulnerabilities: 2 ● Informational Vulnerabilities: 1 Total number of vulnerabilities identified: 3 4.
